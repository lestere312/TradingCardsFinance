      We currently have a page for all major tables besides intersection tables<br>
      for our M:M relationships. The Deck and Collection page are two different<br>
      ways to represent similar data.<br><br>
      Accounts:<br> Shows each acount with option to delete them and create a new one<br><br>
      Deck:<br> Shows each deck at the top of the screen with options to add cards and decks.<br>
      Selecting a deck will show you each card in the deck and the user. Cards from here<br>
      can be deleted as well as the entire deck with the delete deck botton.<br><br>
      Collection:<br> Shows all cards in all collections in a table while showing what<br>
      collection they are a part of. Lower on the screen is a table displaying <br>
      which accounts own each colleciton. There are also options to add cards<br>
      and collections.<br><br>
      Card Database:<br> This page shows all the cards that can be part of collections<br>
      and decks. Here you can search by for sale and name as well as add cards<br>
      and update them.
