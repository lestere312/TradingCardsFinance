      This is a mock up of our website to utilize our backend database.<br>
      Each page represents a table  in our database besides this landing page.<br>
      This example currently only has one deck and collection but future <br>
      examples will have multiple of each.<br>
      The Cards page is a list of all the cards in our database.<br>
      A user can add cards at the bottom of their collection and deck page.<br>
      Next to the card on both deck and collection there is an option to delete<br>
      the card from that table.<br>
      The account page will show information about what the overall account owns.
